            <h2>Site name:</h2>
            <p>The name of the site is <strong>Garden of Peace</strong><br>
                a posible URL would be: www.restingop.com<br>
                I chose this name because the place I work has this same name but in spanish, it represents a garden where we can have our loved ones that are resting in peace.
